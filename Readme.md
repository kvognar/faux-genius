== Faux Genius

This is a clone of [Genius](www.genius.com), a user-driven text annotation site. Users can upload song lyrics (or poems, or any other body of text), and anyone can annotate them, creating a rich, collaboratively made reference library that reveals the history, context and hidden meaning behind every song.

Instructions for use: 

* Highlight text to bring up an annotation prompt.

* Fill in the text box that appears. Add images if you like.

* Submit and see your new contribution!
